## 🗄️ Data Storage

All data is stored in the browser's **localStorage**:

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `hotel_auth_users` | List of all users |
| `hotel_auth_session` | Currently logged-in user session |
| `hotel_expenses_<userId>` | Expense records per user |

> Data persists across page refreshes but is browser-specific. Clearing browser data will erase all records.
